Unfortunately, ~deepin-wine~ binary doesn't work on my arch. But
~wine~ on the system already works for Deepin-Wechat. So here's a
quick workaround.

#+begin_src bash
uname -a
yay -S aur/deepin-wxwork aur/deepin-wine
# Linux archie 5.0.3-arch1-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue Mar 19 13:09:13 UTC 2019 x86_64 GNU/Linux
