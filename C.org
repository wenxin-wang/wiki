* Alignment
See [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt][Kernel Guide]]. Quote:

In summary, the 2 main scenarios where you may run into unaligned access
problems involve:

- Casting variables to types of different lengths (longer ?)
- Pointer arithmetic followed by access to at least 2 bytes of data

Check src_c{CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS}.

** DMA

Must see if DMA device can do unaligned access, too.

** NET_IP_ALIGN

- On architecture that require aligned loads: 4-byte bounds -> NET_IP_ALIGN = 4*n + 2 (Ether header 14 byte)
- PowerPC: 0, because unaligned DMA access is every expensive
- If ether card cannot do unaligned DMA, need to copy.
