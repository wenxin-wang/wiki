** Fields

[[http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/skb_data.html][A good introduction]], I borrow some of the figures here.

** Alignment of IP Packets

There's [[https://lwn.net/Articles/89597/][an article]] on LWN.net that discuss the impact of unaligned memory access
on CPU and DMA. If we align IP packets, then DMA access is unaligned; if not,
then CPU access is unaligned. The cost of the two kinds of penalties varies
between architecture, and thus different choices are made.
