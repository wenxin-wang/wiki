* Windows Remote Gameplay

First install Nvidia Geforce Experience on the game PC, turn on Nvidia Shield,
then install Moonlight on the clients.

Setup [[wiki:OpenVPN][OpenVPN]] if not in a local network. Add mstsc to Nvidia Shield if remote
desktop control is needed. Do not use Windows' rdp, as it will logout current
user and Nvidia Shield would stop working.

Setup a gaming user if wanted. It could be the default user that can login
without password.
